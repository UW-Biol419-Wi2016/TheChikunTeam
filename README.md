Project Proposal for BIOL519

We will likely be working on a project looking at the CHikungunya virus and environmental transmission factors.

Main Question: 
What are the environmental factors that contribute to the increased probability of local transmission of the chikungunya virus?
	
Additional Steps to take:
	1) Find the final source for the Chikungunya virus data - WHO, CDC
	2) Find an environmental data source (EPA, WHO, NOAA, CDC etc.) temperature, humidity, precipitation). - Alexandria 
	3) How do we scale down the amount of geographic information to countries or regions of the world instead of cities?
We also need to scale it down to a time period.  The data for each country has been taken on a month-to-month basis.

Climate data for temperature in 2011 can be found to download at http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/climate-change.
A data set with climate change in various countries can be found at http://berkeleyearth.lbl.gov/state-list/.

Project Proposal
	The Chikungunya virus, that causes fever and intense muscle pain, is transmitted to humans through bites by infected mosquitos. There is no known cure for this illness today and it is often misdiagnosed as dengue, as they share many similar symptoms. The Chikungunya virus has in recent years spread from Africa, Asia, and India to Europe and the Americas. We would like to study the likelihood of the Chikungunya virus in a certain area using temperature and precipitation data as predictors. 
	We will be using regression analysis to check the correlation of temperature and precipitation data recorded from NOAA to the number of Chikungunya cases reported in the Americas found on the World Health Organization (WHO) website. We would then perform an LDA and PCA analysis to check how well temperature and precipitation are in predicting if the Chikungunya will be found in a given area.
