Project Proposal for BIOL519

We will likely be working on a project looking at the CHikungunya virus and environmental transmission factors.

Main Question: 
What are the environmental factors that contribute to the increased probability of local transmission of the chikungunya virus?
	
Additional Steps to take:
	1) Find the final source for the Chikungunya virus data - WHO, CDC
	2) Find an environmental data source (EPA, WHO, NOAA, CDC etc.) temperature, humidity, precipitation). - Alexandria 
	3) How do we scale down the amount of geographic information to countries or regions of the world instead of cities?
We also need to scale it down to a time period.  The data for each country has been taken on a month-to-month basis.
